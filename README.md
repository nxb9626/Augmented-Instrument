# Augmented-Instrument
A tool for augmenting an instrument or voice with a synthesizer

# What it does
It reads the input from your microphone (uses the system default), determines the pitch, and outputs that as midi to the computer to be picked up in a software synthesizer, in the same way a hardware midi controller would.
This output was tested using the [Helm Synthesizer](https://tytel.org/helm/)
